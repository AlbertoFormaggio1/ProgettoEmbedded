## General Information
This app was realized as final project for the course Embedded Systems Programming at the University of Padua, taught the professor Fantozzi Carlo.

This app is made of 1 activity, holding 2 fragments, and a service.

MainActivity is responsible for asking the permissions to the user.

RealTimeFragment shows the live location (i.e. Longitude, Latitude and Altitude) of the user both graphically (on a map) and numerically. 

ChartFragment displays a chart for the altitude and a map showing for latitude and longitude, showing the data registered in the last 5 minutes.
The data are collected every 5 seconds.
